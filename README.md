# Simple implementation of raytraced computer graphics

This project was made following along Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing in One Weekend in August of 2021. It differs in a few ways. Mainly, this produces .bmp images rather than the simpler .ppm filetype. I've also tried to customize the materials and add in additional shapes.
